Please note that this is a fork of the [following](https://github.com/actions-ecosystem/action-get-latest-tag) action.
I create it to fix the [following](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-10-11-github-actions-deprecating-save-state-and-set-output-commands/) issue.
The original repository already has multiple PRs that fix this issue, but they have been ignored for a very long time.

Please refer to the docs in the original repository for more information.
